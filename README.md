## Hanseaticsoft React-Redux Coding Challenge
Your task is to create a running app that showcases the basic data flow functionality of a React-Redux app and some
basic styling, using CSS preprocessors.
We are providing you a collection of code snippets that you can use as a starting point. You are free (and encouraged)
to refactor and create a file structure that makes sense to you.
You will find code comments in certain parts of our snippets that hint at what should be done at that point in the code.

Please hand in the challenge in the form of a Gitlab repository that we can check out. The app should be runnable for us
 to be tested in the browser.

*The final result should be a list displaying the vessels we provided as `mockData`. The mock data should be loaded on
first render. When clicking the "Toggle Details" button, each vessel item should additionally display its details.*

*You may structure the code as you like but you should make use of all three components we provided as snippets.*

## Requirements
- Use create-react-app to set up your project.
- Refactor everything into TypeScript, define types and interfaces as needed.
- Refactor all class components that we provided into functional components.
- Use SCSS for styling the app.
- Use the code snippets we provided to create a basic React-Redux architecture.

## Bonus Tasks
Complete these for extra points:
- Use the styled-components library to style the app.
- Implement a delete functionality for the vessel items, removing them from the Redux store.
